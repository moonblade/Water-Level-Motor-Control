# Water-Level-Motor-Control
Setup a cron tab to run on a raspberry pi, whenever water level reaches critical values, some action can be triggered

pcb design done [on easyEDA](https://easyeda.com/editor#id=b41bb882b032482bb2b21c925477a603) but ended up using normal dot board since pcb seemed to be too small for some reason.
